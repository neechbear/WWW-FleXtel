DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a very basic OO interface to FleXtel telephone
    number redirection webpage.

METHODS
  new
     my $flextel = WWW::FleXtel->new(
             number   => "0701776655",
             pin      => "1234",
             account  => "A99999", # not required
             password => "password", # not required
         );

    Create a new WWW::FleXtel object. Currently the *account* and *password*
    parameters are unsed and therefor do not need to be passed to this
    constructor method.

    This method does have any mandatory parameters. However values passed
    this constructor method will be used as default fallback values if they
    are not passed to the subsequent accessor methods detailed below.

    number
        Specifies the default FleXtel number to use for all subsequent
        queries.

    pin Specifies the default PIN to use for all subsqeuent queries.

    account
        Specifies the default FleXtel account number to use for all
        subsequent queries. This parameter is not currently used, but may be
        used in future releases.

    password
        Specifies the default account password to use for all subsequent
        queries. This parameter is not currently use, but may be used in
        future releases.

    timeout
        Specifies (in seconds) the timeout for all HTTP connections. By
        default this is set to 15 seconds.

    cache_ttl
        Specifies (in seconds) the TTL for values to be cached internally
        within the WWW::FleXtel object. By default this is set to 5 seconds.

  get_destination
     my $destination = $flextel->get_destination;
     print "Diverted to $destination\n";

    Retrieves the destination telephone number that your FleXtel number is
    currently diverted to.

  set_destination
     my $destination = $flextel->set_destination(destination => "01923001122");
     print "Diverted to $destination\n";

    Sets the destination telephone number that your FleXtel number is
    diverted to.

  get_phonebook
     my $phonebook = $flextel->get_phonebook;
     use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
     print Dumper($phonebook);
     
 my $destination = $flextel->get_destination;
     my ($person) = grep(/\S/, map {
             $_->{title} if defined $_ && $_->{number} eq $destination
         } @{$phonebook}); $person ||= "*not recorded*";
     print "$destination is $person in your phonebook\n";

    This method extracts the indexes, names and numbers from your FleXtel
    number's phonebook.

  get_icd
     my $icd = $flextel->get_icd;

  get_email
     my $notification_address = $flextel->get_email;

TODO
    Add support for retrieving a list of all FleXtel phone numbers attached
    to an account number.
