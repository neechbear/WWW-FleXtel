NAME
    WWW::FleXtel - Manipulate FleXtel phone number redirection

SYNOPSIS
     use strict;
     use WWW::FleXtel qw();
     use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
     
 my $flextel = WWW::FleXtel->new(
             number   => "0701776655",
             pin      => "1234",
             account  => "A99999",
             password => "password",
         );
     
 printf("Diverted to %s\n", $flextel->get_destination);
     $flextel->set_destination(destination => "01923001122");
     printf("Diverted to %s\n", $flextel->get_destination);
     
 print Dumper($flextel->get_phonebook);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an OO interface to FleXtel telephone number
    redirection webpage.

    This module is still actively under development, is not yet feature
    complete and still needs to be fully documented. There is a possibility
    accessor method names may change before the final release.

METHODS
  new
     my $flextel = WWW::FleXtel->new(
             number   => "0701776655",
             pin      => "1234",
             account  => "A99999",
             password => "password",
         );

    Create a new WWW::FleXtel object. Currently the *account* and *password*
    parameters are unsed and therefor do not need to be passed to this
    constructor method.

    This method does have any mandatory parameters. However values passed
    this constructor method will be used as default fallback values if they
    are not passed to the subsequent accessor methods detailed below.

  get_destination
     my $destination = $flextel->get_destination;
     print "Diverted to $destination\n";

    Retrieves the destination telephone number that your FleXtel number is
    currently diverted to.

  set_destination
     my $destination = $flextel->set_destination(destination => "01923001122");
     print "Diverted to $destination\n";

    Sets the destination telephone number that your FleXtel number is
    diverted to.

  get_phonebook
     my $phonebook = $flextel->get_phonebook;
     use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
     print Dumper($phonebook);
     
 my $destination = $flextel->get_destination;
     my ($person) = grep(/\S/, map {
             $_->{title} if defined $_ && $_->{number} eq $destination
         } @{$phonebook}) || "*not recorded*";
     print "$destination is $person in your phonebook\n";

    This method extracts the indexes, names and numbers from your FleXtel
    number's phonebook. This method has the potential to stop working in the
    future since it gathers the information by performing very basic parsing
    of the JavaScript object assignments on your FleXtel number's rerouting
    webpage.
